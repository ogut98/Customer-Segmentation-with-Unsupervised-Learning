# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This data science project focuses on customer segmentation using Python, where advanced clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering are applied. The primary objective is to unravel distinct customer groups based on their behavior, allowing for targeted business strategies.

## Key Features

📊 **Data-Driven Segmentation:**
   - Leverage the power of Python, utilizing pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and segmentation.

🚀 **Optimal Cluster Identification:**
   - Employ K-Means clustering with a scientific approach to uncover meaningful customer segments, boosting insights into user behavior.

📈 **Statistical Insights:**
   - Dive into each segment's statistics to understand customer nuances, exploring metrics like order frequency, customer value, recency, and tenure.

🌐 **Hierarchical Clustering Visualization:**
   - Implement Hierarchical Clustering with dendrogram visualizations for a holistic view of the data's hierarchical structure.

🧪 **Feature Transformation:**
   - Use log transformations and Min-Max scaling to ensure data normalization and prepare it for accurate clustering.

📉 **Skewness Assessment:**
   - Dynamically check and address skewness in the dataset, enhancing the reliability of statistical analyses.
